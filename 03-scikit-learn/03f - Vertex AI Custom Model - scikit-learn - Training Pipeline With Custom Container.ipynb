    "\n",
    "Where a model gets trained is where it consumes computing resources.  With Vertex AI, you have choices for configuring the computing resources available at training.  This notebook is an example of an execution environment.  When it was set up there were choices for machine type and accelerators (GPUs).  \n",
    "\n",
    "In the [03 - Vertex AI Custom Model - scikit-learn - in Notebook](./03%20-%20Vertex%20AI%20Custom%20Model%20-%20scikit-learn%20-%20in%20Notebook.ipynb) notebook, the model training happened directly in the notebook.  The model was then imported to Vertex AI and deployed to an endpoint for online predictions. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this `03a-03i` series of demonstrations, the same model is trained using managed computing resources in Vertex AI Training as managed jobs.  These jobs will be demonstrated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "-  Custom Job that trains and saves (to GCS) a model from a python script (`03a`), python source distribution (`03b`), and custom container (`03c`)\n",
    "-  Training Pipeline that trains and registers a model from a python script (`03d`), python source distribution (`03e`), and custom container (`03f`)\n",
    "-  Hyperparameter Tuning Jobs from a python script (`03g`), python source distribution (`03h`), and custom container (`03i`)\n",
    "\n",
    "**This Notebook (`03f`): An extension of `03c` as a Training Pipeline that saves the model to Vertex AI > Model Registry**\n",

    "A custom container is built that contains the script and required Python libaries.  For more guidance on this process visit the tip notebook [Python Custom Containers](../Tips/Python%20Custom%20Containers.ipynb).  The script, along with a `requirement.txt` and `Dockerfile` are stored in GCS and then used by Cloud Build to extend the pre-built Vertex AI container and store the resulting image in Artifact Registry.  \n",

For that reason, the first step is creating a Dockerfile for the workflow and storing it in GCS. The next step is running Cloud Build and using the client to specify the Build config rather than a config file.  The steps of the build config start with getting the code (git clone, or copy from GCS) and copying the Dockerfile.  \n",

Many of the most common ones are explored in the tips notebook [Python Custom Containers](../Tips/Python%20Custom%20Containers.ipynb).  The method used here is the simplest - copy the training code directly into the container.  The other methods include packaging the training code as a Python Distribution and using `pip install` in from GCS, GitHub and even Artifact Registry as a private repository."
